The salsa was very good, nice flavor with just a right amount of heat...in other words you could taste the salsa.  I ordered a chicken burro which was good, not great.  the chicken didnt seem to be grilled but must have been, no flavor just blah. Prices OK, service very good, tea and water pitcher on table which is great for those refills. Will give it another try.', 'Amazing! I Purple rice makes me healthier.\\\\nI had Las Vegas roll, Crunch California, Oh My God, and Crazy roll. Foods are soooo good! I will revisit there again!', \"The food here was good, but wasn't anything to rave about.\\\\n\\\\nWe started with the fried calamari.  It was served with banana peppers, which I love.  The calamari itself was tender and not rubbery.\\\\n\\\\nWe both went for the chicken parmesan.  My husband loved it, I thought it was just average.  I wasn't in love with the flavor of the sauce, so had to doctor it up with red pepper flakes and parmesan.\\\\n\\\\nThe service was not that great.  Our waitress was pleasant, but never came around.\\\\n\\\\nYou can get a decent meal here, but for the price, you will not be blown away.\", \"If i could give a 3.5 start I would but between a 3 and 4.. I'll lean towards a 4. Prices are reasonable for getting food on the strip... the sandwhich I got was wayyy too salty and don't get me wrong I love salty food.. but apparently even this got my pallet questioning the level of saltiness.. \\\\n\\\\nIt's a good  place to go grab a quick bite.  I'll come back again and give it another go.....\", 'I have to agree to get a service in a separate room is much better...\\\\nI had an express facial... It was nice to lay down in a peaceful room.  It was worth every penny just for that. \\\\nIt was not the best facial, not even close. \\\\nbut for my sanity to leave the craze of the airport for a bit, I will do it again.\\\\n\\\\nMaybe the services will improve?', \"Hmm....I ordered their breakfast crossiant sandwich, and it seriously tasted like I made it at home. Nothing fancy about it. Even their grilled chicken panini ($12) wasn't as great as I would have thought; the bread (I believe it's ciabatta?) was a little too hard for me.\\\\n\\\\nThe gelato was pretty good with a wide selection of choices; I had their pistachio (the best I've had) and lychee (which was mediocre, as it had flavor initially but lost it towards the end). If I was just rating the gelato, I would probably give this place 4 stars...\", 'Great staff.  Love the new menu.  Always friendly.  Like the cigar smoke room .', 'I liked that they offer a variety of vegetarian meals , their food was fresh , i usually like the falafel to come as a small round pieces instead of a big one, other than that i think this place is a good choice to get middle eastern food in oakland !', \"I decided to meet a friend here on a whim for a relaxing Friday night dinner. I was looking for a place close to my house that specifically did a sushi happy hour. I figured this establishment was a good bet based on the reviews. Not so much. I then realized when it comes to sushi in Arizona, I've been steered wrong so many times, which makes me believe most people in Arizona haven't had excellent sushi, on a coast. When you've eaten a lot of sushi, you know quality vs. crap. \\\\n\\\\nThe good thing was this place wasn't the worst sushi I've had, but it definitely was down there on the list. The pieces of fish were huge and disproportionate to the rice, which should be the first red flag. Sushi is small & pricey for a reason. \\\\n\\\\nThe fish was cut haphazardly, the nigiri was three times the size as the rice beneath it. Oh, and the weirdest thing was this strange clear gooey sauce under all the rolls AND nigiri. At first I thought I was tasting something funny with the fish but after asking the waitress, we found they put ponzu sauce on EVERY single roll and under the rice with the nigiri. Now, don't get me wrong, I like ponzu sauce, but not on everything. When I'm ordering a yellowtail roll, I don't want a gooey sweet sauce masking the flavor of the fish and rice. Maybe they were trying to mask the flavor of the fish and rice? Hmmmmm. \\\\n\\\\nI ordered one of the special rolls. It was nothing special. I specifically noticed the tuna on the outside to be too firm and chewy and the spicy tuna on the inside to be way too mushy. It was all a horrible consistency.\\\\n\\\\nThe bill was cheap, $67 for three people and that's with about twice as much fish as we could eat. Would I go back? No. Was it the worst? No, but I'm not a fan of taking risks with sushi.\", 'Service was excellent! Food was not. Coffee was cold and metallic tasting, burgers had a weird taste. Nothing special with everything else we ordered.']\n",

They were offering a serious discount for their first couple months. I got a Shellac manicure (white tip) and it was PHENOMENAL.

Service: Although the line was long at the check-in, some of the clerks were just looking into the computer screens and not bothering to help ppl check in faster.   Unit: EVERYTHING in the unit  was very dated: from plumbing to the bed covers. Not even basic toiletries were provided. No tea or coffee pot.  Old bulky TV's taking up lots of space. ..
